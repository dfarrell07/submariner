# Submariner Governance

## Open Governance Checklist

The opengovernance.dev project [provides the following
checklist](https://github.com/opengovernance/opengovernance.dev/blob/master/README.md#checklist) for defining open governance.

Submariner's answers are provided for each point.

This is not meant to define Submariner's governance, but instead to document it clearly. Authoritative sources are cited inline.
